# Programming Assignment #1

### This project takes screenshots from an Android phone (and their respective xml files) and outputs the same screenshots with their leaf-level components highlighted in yellow boxes.


## Dependencies
- This project needs `python3.9` or a later version to run properly.
- `pillow` and `xml.etree.ElementTree` are the only imports, and both should work as long as `python3.9` is being used.

## To Run
- You must be in the `Programming-Assignment-Data` folder.
- Run `python3.9 solution.py`
- Ideally this project would be run on MacOS, since it was only tested on MacOS.
